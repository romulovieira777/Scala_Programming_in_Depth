// Points to remember
//1. It will first execute the OUTSIDE function "exec()" and then execute the INSIDE
// function "time()" every time t is being referred.
//2. Since OUTSIDE function "exec()" got executed first, it calls INSIDE function "time()"
// using the REFERENCED VATIABLE t, it is called as "Function by Name"
